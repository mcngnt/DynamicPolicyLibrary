The error message indicates a failure to connect to a specific server, which suggests that the issue is not with the search query itself but rather with the connection.\n\nNew Plan:\n1. Check the internet connection and ensure that it is stable.\n2. Try searching for a simpler query, such as \"airports near Niagara Falls\", to see if the search results can be displayed.\n3. If the simpler query yields results, try modifying the search query to include more specific keywords, such as \"international airports\".\n4. If the issue persists, try using a different search engine or website to search for US international airports near Niagara Falls.\n5. Consider contacting the website administrator or support team to report the connection error and seek assistance."
