Verify that the results match your search objective.\n* For searches not related to CMU, you can directly enter your search query without centering the map around a specific location.\n* Regardless of the type of search, ensure that your final action is to return the results in a structured format, such as listing the names and addresses of the found places. \n\nExamples:\n- If the query is \"find cafes near CMU Hunt Library\", the steps would involve:\n  1.

						"guidance": "* To find places near a given location, first determine if the location is related to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) or not. \n* If the location is related to CMU, you must center the map around Carnegie Mellon University. Do this by searching for \"Carnegie Mellon University\" in the search bar and then clicking on the university's location from the search results. This step is crucial for ensuring the map is centered correctly.\n* When formulating your final search query, exclude the word \"CMU\" to prevent parsing issues. For example, if you're looking for cafes near the CMU Hunt Library, your final search query should be \"cafes near Hunt Library\".\n* Enter your revised search query into the search bar and click the 'Search' button to retrieve the results.\n* The results should include a list of places matching your search query, along with their names, addresses, and potentially links to more details. Verify that the results match your search objective.\n* For searches not related to CMU, you can directly enter your search query without centering the map around a specific location.\n* Regardless of the type of search, ensure that your final action is to return the results in a structured format, such as listing the names and addresses of the found places. \n\nExamples:\n- If the query is \"find cafes near CMU Hunt Library\", the steps would involve:\n  1. Searching for \"Carnegie Mellon University\" and clicking on it to center the map.\n  2. Then searching for \"cafes near Hunt Library\".\n  3. Clicking the 'Search' button and verifying the results include cafes near Hunt Library.\n- For a query like \"bars near Carnegie Music Hall\", which does not refer to a CMU location, the steps would be:\n  1. Directly searching for \"bars near Carnegie Music Hall\".\n  2. Clicking the 'Search' button and verifying the results include bars near Carnegie Music Hall.\n  3. Returning the results in a structured format.",
