- In gitlab fresh start 1 : 0.46
{
			"name": "GetNewSubroutine",
			"description": "There isn't a suitable subroutine for finding and clicking the most recent open issue after navigating to the issues page.",
			"query": "Find and click the most recent open issue"
		}

SOLUTION : more precise in get_policy prompt


- Not specific enough in policy creation. Avoid using overlap at the cost of precision. In task 102, the policy that was created (instead of smth like filterByLabel) : 

"name": "ExtractIssueList",
			"description": "Extracts and lists the most recent open issues from a GitLab issues page.",
			"query": "labels:help wanted"

SOLUTION : encourage new policy even if slight overlap

- Critique is too optimistic : say it is a success even tough it is not one
Task 102 : only typed help wanted in the search box instead of actually filtering by label and the critique called it a success

SOLUTION : include observation at the start of the policy for comparison to see if the policy had the right effect
			(enough token ????)
