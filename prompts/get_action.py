- `click [id]`: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g. , ‚Äòclick [7] ‚Äô If clicking on a specific element doesn ‚Äô t trigger the transition to your desired web state , this is due to the element‚Äôs lack of interactivity or GUI visibility . In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- `type [id] [content] [press enter after = 0|1]`: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default , the ‚Äò Enter ‚Äô key is pressed after typing unless ‚Äòpress enter after ‚Äô is set to 0. E.g. , ‚Äòtype [15] [Carnegie Mellon University ] [1] ‚Äô If you can ‚Äô t find what you‚Äôre looking for on your first attempt , consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- `go_home`: To return to the homepage.
- `go_back`: Revert to the previous state of the page.
