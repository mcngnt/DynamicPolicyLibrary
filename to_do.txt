To-do :

- abort task if critique deems failure and restart the task: max 3 restarts ?

- implement Occam selective past observations

- general guidelines for each website (root policy guidance text)
	- How can the model know OpenStreetMap work beforehand ? Especially useful when making plan
		- Other solution : make more specific policy that can actually handle the plan + actually have feedback on the task as a whole (without that, get_policy module can't improve). But does it work for very long trajectories ? No. Simply give some higher order policies example.
Solution : incentivize get_policy to make very high level function so that the innerworkings of the website does not affect the relevance of thr planning step.
Eg. is you need to find closest airports to a place, call subroutine closest_element_to_place. If the task is clearly seperated into two subtasks, (by "and" for intsnace), use two subtasks.
Need to provide examples in the context for this solution to know what are the boundaries of a subtask.



What was done :
Removed writing policy for final stop

Improve get_policy plans
