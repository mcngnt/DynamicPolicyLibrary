TO-DO :

- Implement Occam improvements : selective observation

- Better logs for analysis


WHATS WAS DONE :

- Provide url in context
- Percentage of tasks with complex trajectories (23.41%)
- Simplify architecture : only one agent to take all decisions
	During exploration phase : curriculum at the start of the task to create useful policies (generate at most 2 policies to avoid useless simplistic policies and take advantage of incremental discorvery)
