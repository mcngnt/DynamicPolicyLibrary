TO-DO :

- Implement Occam improvements : selective observation


- Website specific policies ?

- Avoid programmed failure inside guidance


- Use expert trajectory or Learn By Interact / BAGEL technique to get that variety ?

- Shorter reason : only what the action does (Sort in ascending order, Use the main search bar, Open issues, ...)

- Hierarchical planning : if the task is too hard, divide it into two subtasks (will it work if the policy maker has no special knowledge about the subtask ? -> Creating false subsubtask that I will be hard to get)

- Encourage agent to use subroutine as much as possible when needed

- Rewrite guidance if success for positive reinforcement (identify path to success and incorporate it into fuidance)


- When resetting policy : include old guidance text and ask the model to expressively explore another path to succes ???



WHAT WAS DONE :

- provide initial observcation to critique

- Encourage policy creation even if overlap (for now prefer to use existing policy even if it doesn't match)

- Positively reinforce guidance after success if too many failures

- Only give information about key actions in guidance

- Complete re-hauling of the rewriting agent
