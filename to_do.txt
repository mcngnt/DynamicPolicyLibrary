If policy stack empty :
- Retrieve polcies related to the objective
- Incentive to call a policy (either a new or existing one)

If policy stack not empty :
- Retrieve polcicies related to current policy
- Disable calling new policies
- Can only call retrieved policies / atomic actions


Problems encountered :
- Answered "create_subroutine find_nearby_loaction" instead of "find_nearby_location [Airport]"
- Does not respect the atomic_action [id] format (instead atomic_action [name])
-
