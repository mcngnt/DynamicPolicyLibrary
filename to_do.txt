TO-DO :

- Implement Occam improvements : selective observation

- Add Screenshots


- Guidance text : only contain information about choking point to shorten it

- Website specific policies ?

- Avoid programmed failure inside guidance


- Use expert trajectory or Learn By Interact / BAGEL technique to get that variety ?

- Shorter reason : only what the action does (Sort in ascending order, Use the main search bar, Open issues, ...)

- Hierarchical planning : if the task is too hard, divide it into two subtasks (will it work if the policy maker has no special knowledge about the subtask ? -> Creating false subsubtask that I will be hard to get)

- Encourage agent to use subroutine as much as possible when needed


WHAT WAS DONE :

- Using human-written policy that gives the goto procedure greatly improves performance

- If policy fails too many times (3 times in a row ?) : reset its guidance text
	(((-> Goal : encourage exploration so that the model can actually find something that works (using old trajectory or old guidance ?) : ability to learn from previous strategy)))

- Provide policy description inside the objective (not clear what is the goal behind Examin_Issues [flacky_test] without description of what Examine_Issues is supposed to do)
